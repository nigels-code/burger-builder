# Burger Builder

I wrote this while following Maximilian Schwarzmuller's "React - The Complete Guide" course.

A web application for configuring and ordering a hamburger.

Technologies used: React, Firebase (Realtime Database), Javascript, HTML, CSS.

I have set up a CI/CD pipeline between Github and Netlify.  
Open <https://burgerbuilderxx.netlify.app/> to see a production version of this project.

## Installation
```sh
npm install
```
## Usage
```sh
npm start
```
This runs the application in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in a browser.
